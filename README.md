# Coursera-Algorithmic-Toolbox

This repository contains all solutions for the course [Algorithmic Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox/) offered on Coursera. The assignment solutions are in CPP(mostly) and Java(some part).

Disclaimer: The below solutions are for reference only. This is all my work.Please design and implement your own algorithms to pass the course.

# Contributing

All contributions are welcome. Just make a PR. Below is a list of general improvements that need to be added that I would love help with:

Improve documentation
Clean up code (adding docstrings)
Better algorithms that reduce time complexity
